# Automated-Greenhouse-using-IoT
Monitoring the internal parameters of greenhouse like temperature and humidity and controlling the devices remotely using IoT.

Propose contribution to the development of a prototype of an automated greenhouse monitoring and control system. This project presents the design and development of an electronic system based on a Wi-Fi embedded microcontroller that integrates remote sensing functions rooted in the cloud computing using internet of things (IoT). The system allows the acquisition of different climatic parameters in an agricultural greenhouse and in addition, this electronic system achieves the remote controlling of climatic parameters, by cloud computing solutions (internet of things). 


## Devices and Apps Used:
1.*NodeMCU*:NodeMcu is an open source IOT platform. It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 wi-fi soc, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module. Basically you can say it's a integrated platform of ESP8266 wifi module and Arduino platform, so that you need not worry about circuit connection of WiFi Module with Arduino individually with wires which creates a problem while connecting to the internet.

2.*Blynk App*: BLYNK is not just "another iot cloud". It's an end-to-end solution which saves our time and resources when building applications for connected products and services.You can download its app from Google play store for your mobile device.
